<span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia">Greetings! </span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> I am Md. Rakibul Islam, a dedicated educator and researcher currently serving as a Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.aust.edu/cse">Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> at <a href="https://www.aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)</a>. I am a committed academic with a passion for fostering innovation, bringing a wealth of knowledge and a strong enthusiasm for advancing the field of computer science. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST), where I developed a solid foundation in software development, data analysis, and computational theory. My academic background is complemented by practical experience, allowing me to deliver a comprehensive and real-world perspective to my students.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> Before joining AUST as a Lecturer, I served as a Lecturer at <a href="https://new.seu.edu.bd/">Southeast University (SEU)</a>. During my tenure at SEU, I contributed to course material development, mentored students in research and practical projects, and taught core computer science courses with a focus on instilling a deep understanding of both the theoretical and applied aspects of the field. My teaching philosophy revolves around active learning, critical thinking, and preparing students to become lifelong learners and problem solvers. At AUST, I continue to engage students through hands-on projects, innovative teaching methods, and a focus on the latest advancements in technology. I emphasize collaborative learning and work to create a stimulating academic environment that inspires curiosity and a passion for discovery among my students.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> My research interests lie at the intersection of cutting-edge technologies and real-world applications. My areas of expertise and ongoing research include:</p>

<details>
<summary><b>Vision-Language Models</b></summary>
<span><font size="3"> <p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> <em>An exciting domain that bridges computer vision and natural language processing to enable machines to understand and interact with multimodal information. My work focuses on developing advanced VLMs for tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and multimodal retrieval, emphasizing creating models that are context-aware, efficient, and generalizable. A critical research gap I address involves enhancing the alignment between visual and textual representations, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or limited data. I am also keen on tackling challenges related to the semantic grounding of text in complex visual scenes and improving the modelsâ€™ ability to perform zero-shot or few-shot learning. Through my research, I aim to push the boundaries of multimodal AI, making it more robust and applicable to real-world problems.</em> </p></font></span>

<summary><b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b></summary>
<span><font size="3"> <p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> <em>Driven by the desire to bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding, I investigate NLP models for tasks such as sentiment analysis, language translation, language generation and conversational AI. My work contributes to the advancement of human-computer interaction and automated understanding of human language.</em></p></font></span>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Computer Vision (CV)</b></summary>
<span><font size="3"> <p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> <em>I explore the development and application of algorithms that enable computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. My work involves image processing, image generation, object detection, and facial recognition, with a keen interest in practical implementations across various industries.</em> </p></font></span>
</details>


<details>
<summary><b>Deep Learning (DL) & Machine Learning (ML)</b></summary>
<span><font size="3"> <p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> <em>With a focus on designing intelligent systems, I am involved in developing models that can learn from and adapt to data. My research in this domain covers supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, neural network architectures, and reinforcement learning applications.</em></p></font></span>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Vision and Speech</b></summary>
<span><font size="3"> <p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> <em>An interdisciplinary field that combines visual and auditory information to enable more robust and natural human-computer interactions. I focus on developing systems for tasks such as audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), lip reading, and multimodal emotion recognition, where integrating visual and speech modalities enhances performance in challenging conditions like noisy environments. A key research gap I address is improving the temporal and semantic alignment of visual and speech data, particularly in scenarios involving diverse speakers, accents, and occlusions. I also work on advancing models that can generalize well across real-world applications, bridging the gap between academic research and practical deployment. Through my work, I aim to create more intuitive, adaptive, and reliable multimodal systems.</em></p></font></span>

<summary><b>NLP and Speech</b></summary>
<span><font size="3"> <p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> <em>The fusion of natural language processing and speech technologies drives advancements in human-computer communication. My research focuses on developing innovative systems for tasks like automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, and spoken language understanding (SLU). A key research gap I address is improving the adaptability of ASR and TTS systems to diverse languages, accents, and speaking styles, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, I explore integrating prosody and context modeling to enhance the naturalness of synthesized speech and the accuracy of spoken language interpretation. My work aims to bridge these gaps, creating robust, inclusive, and context-aware speech-driven NLP solutions for real-world applications.</em></p></font></span>
