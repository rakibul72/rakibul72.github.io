<span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia">Greetings! </span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> I am Md. Rakibul Islam, a dedicated educator and researcher currently serving as a Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.aust.edu/cse">Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> at <a href="https://www.aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)</a>. I am a committed academic with a passion for fostering innovation, bringing a wealth of knowledge and a strong enthusiasm for advancing the field of computer science. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST), where I developed a solid foundation in software development, data analysis, and computational theory. My academic background is complemented by practical experience, allowing me to deliver a comprehensive and real-world perspective to my students.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> Before joining AUST as a Lecturer, I served as a Lecturer at <a href="https://new.seu.edu.bd/">Southeast University (SEU)</a>. During my tenure at SEU, I contributed to course material development, mentored students in research and practical projects, and taught core computer science courses with a focus on instilling a deep understanding of both the theoretical and applied aspects of the field. My teaching philosophy revolves around active learning, critical thinking, and preparing students to become lifelong learners and problem solvers. At AUST, I continue to engage students through hands-on projects, innovative teaching methods, and a focus on the latest advancements in technology. I emphasize collaborative learning and work to create a stimulating academic environment that inspires curiosity and a passion for discovery among my students.</p>
