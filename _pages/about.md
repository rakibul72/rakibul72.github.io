<span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia">Greetings! </span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> I am Md. Rakibul Islam, a dedicated educator and researcher currently serving as a Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.aust.edu/cse">Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> at <a href="https://www.aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)</a>. I am a committed academic with a passion for fostering innovation, bringing a wealth of knowledge and a strong enthusiasm for advancing the field of computer science. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST), where I developed a solid foundation in software development, data analysis, and computational theory. My academic background is complemented by practical experience, allowing me to deliver a comprehensive and real-world perspective to my students.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> Before joining AUST as a Lecturer, I served as a Lecturer at <a href="https://new.seu.edu.bd/">Southeast University (SEU)</a>. During my tenure at SEU, I contributed to course material development, mentored students in research and practical projects, and taught core computer science courses with a focus on instilling a deep understanding of both the theoretical and applied aspects of the field. My teaching philosophy revolves around active learning, critical thinking, and preparing students to become lifelong learners and problem solvers. At AUST, I continue to engage students through hands-on projects, innovative teaching methods, and a focus on the latest advancements in technology. I emphasize collaborative learning and work to create a stimulating academic environment that inspires curiosity and a passion for discovery among my students.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> My research interests lie at the intersection of cutting-edge technologies and real-world applications. My areas of expertise and ongoing research include:</p>

<details>
<summary>Computer Vision (CV)</summary>
<span ><font size="3">I explore the development and application of algorithms that enable computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. My work involves image processing, image generation, object detection, and facial recognition, with a keen interest in practical implementations across various industries.</font></span><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Machine Learning (ML) & Deep Learning (DL)</summary>
<span ><font size="3">With a focus on designing intelligent systems, I am involved in developing models that can learn from and adapt to data. My research in this domain covers supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, neural network architectures, and reinforcement learning applications.</font></span><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</summary>
<span ><font size="3">Driven by the desire to bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding, I investigate NLP models for tasks such as sentiment analysis, language translation, language generation and conversational AI. My work contributes to the advancement of human-computer interaction and automated understanding of human language.</font></span><br>
</details>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> I am actively engaged in research projects that leverage computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing to solve complex problems. I am always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate with researchers and industry partners, aiming to work on multidisciplinary projects that have a tangible impact on society. My research not only contributes to theoretical advancements but also focuses on developing solutions that can be effectively deployed in real-world settings.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> Apart from teaching and research, I actively participate in academic events, workshops, and seminars. I am committed to mentoring students, fostering an environment where new ideas and innovations can flourish. My future goals include expanding my research into unexplored domains, collaborating with global experts, and contributing to the academic excellence of AUST and the broader computer science community. I believe that the rapid evolution of technology brings both immense opportunities and challenges. As a lecturer and researcher, I am committed to being at the forefront of this change, preparing my students to excel in a data-driven world and contributing to the development of intelligent and responsible technology.
